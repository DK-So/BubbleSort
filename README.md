# Bubble Sorting Algorithm

This project demonstrates a simple implementation of the **bubble sort** algorithm in C++ using the Xcode IDE. It sorts an array of integers and prints both the unsorted and sorted versions of the array.

## Project Overview

- The main C++ file, `main.cpp`, contains a vector of integers and implements a bubble sort algorithm to sort the elements in ascending order.
- The code first displays the unsorted array, performs the sorting, and then outputs the sorted array.
  
### Key Features:
- **Bubble Sort Algorithm**: A basic sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
- **Vector Operations**: Uses the C++ STL `vector` for dynamic array handling.
  
## How to Build and Run

### Requirements:
- **Xcode**: This project was created using **Xcode**, Apple's IDE for macOS. Ensure you have Xcode installed on your machine.
- **C++ Compiler**: Xcode includes the necessary C++ compiler.

### Steps:
1. Clone or download the project.
2. Open the `Bubblesort.xcodeproj` file in Xcode.
3. Build the project by selecting **Product > Build** in the Xcode menu or by pressing `Cmd+B`.
4. Run the project by selecting **Product > Run** or pressing `Cmd+R`.

### Expected Output:

The program will print the following to the console:
- The original (unsorted) array.
- The sorted array after the bubble sort is applied.

### Example:

```
Original array: 2 5 3 6 9 8 5 
Sorted array: 2 3 5 5 6 8 9 
```
